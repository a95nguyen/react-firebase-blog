        "description": "By layering dark and introspective lyrics over a heavy trap beat and light guitar strokes, BTS delves headfirst into any creative's worst fear: losing their passion for creating. The emo hip-hop track not only explores their passion for music, but also the possible downsides of it: burnout and losing their creative touch. From BTS' view, when music and dancing can no longer touch their hearts, this is how they'd die their first death. It is noteworthy that inspiration is drawn from a quote from Martha Graham: 'A dancer dies twice - once when they stop dancing - and this first death is more painful'."

        "description": "Pandemic life and productivity - two words that have molded into synonyms since the start of COVID-19. Most fail to realize that free time is not an indicator that you should pick up a new language - or learn a new skill - or get ahead in your studies. j-hope - member of BTS and one of the main accredited songwriters on Dis-ease - shines a light on this issue. Through an old-school hip-hop tune, the lyrics showcase the uncertainty and uneasiness of pandemic life and the constant need to work - something we all are experiencing. Although the track focuses on this personal disease (a play on the actual disease that has given us so much free time), the bridge offers hope to listeners: 'No night lasts forever / I've become stronger'."
