        "description": "By layering dark and introspective lyrics over a heavy trap beat and light guitar strokes, BTS delves head first into any creative's worst fear: losing their passion for creating. The emo hip-hop track not only explores their passion for music, but also the possible downsides of it: burnout and losing their creative touch. From BTS' view, when music and dancing can no longer touch their hearts, this is how they'd die their first death. It is noteworthy that inspiration is drawn from a quote from Martha Graham: 'A dancer dies twice - once when they stop dancing - and this first death is more painful'."
